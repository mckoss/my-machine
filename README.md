My portable machine configuration files.  I use this to setup a consitent (Ubuntu) configuration
on the multiple machines I use/administer.

You can setup a new machine by executing:

    wget https://raw.github.com/mckoss/my-machine/master/machine-setup.sh
    chmod +x machine-setup.sh
    ./machine-setup.sh
